abstract = {In a remarkably short timeframe, developing apps for smartphones has gone from an arcane curiosity to an essential skill set. Employers are scrambling to find developers capable of transforming their ideas into apps. Educators interested in filling that void are likewise trying to keep up, and face difficult decisions in designing a meaningful course. There are a plethora of development platforms, but two stand out because of their popularity and divergent approaches - Apple's iOS, and Google's Android. In this paper, we will compare the two, and address the question: which should faculty teach?},
